### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user attempts to delete a customer/service/appointment/part/technician who has the id of 1  (i.e. `deletecustomer 1`).

This diagram is applicable also for other commands such as the add equivalent.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Omitted from this image is that the `XCommand`, being an  instance of`RedoableCommand`, methods related to it is handled here. For more information, scroll down to the relevant section below.

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `XListPanel` (`X` is a placeholder for a specific model list panel  e.g., `CustomerListPanel`, `VehicleListPanel`), `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays specific objects residing in the `Model` such as the `Customer`, `Vehicle`, `Service`, `Appointment` and `PartMap` objects.
* also depends on some mapping classes in the `Model` component as certain objects have an integer array of object ids that refer to another object. One example is the Customer class, which has a `HashSet<Integer>` of `Vehicle` IDs. To associate each `Customer` object with the corresponding `Vehicle` objects, the Model uses an object called `CustomerVehicleMap`. The `UI` component then displays the relevant objects based on these mappings. In essence, the `Model` uses these mapping classes to ensure that objects with references to one another are properly connected and displayed in the user interface.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCustomerCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a customer).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletecustomer 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

This diagram is applicable to all `deleteXCommand` commands.

Omitted from this image is that the `XCommand`, being an  instance of `RedoableCommand`, methods related to it is handled here. For more information, scroll down to the relevant section below.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XCommandParser` (`X` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCustomerCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XCommand` object (e.g., `AddCustomerCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCustomerCommandParser`, `DeleteCustomerCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `X` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueXList` object) where X are Customer/Service/Appointments/Vehicles/Technicians, and all `Part` objects (which are contained in a `partMap` object).
* in the case of X, stores the currently 'selected' `X` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<X>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* in the case of Part, stores the currently 'selected' `Part` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate hashmap.
* in the case of ServiceList, it acts functionally the same as an `UniqueXList` except that the entry can be non-unique.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="1000" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both AutoM8 shop data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ShopStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Feature

### Current Implementation
The add function is facilitated by `AddXCommand` (`X` is a placeholder for the specific entity to be added e.g. `AddCustomerCommand`)

Here `X` can be `Customer/Appointment/Service/Vehicle/Part/Technician`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the `execute("addX args*")` API call.

<img src="images/AddXSequenceDiagram.png"/>

The `addX(x)` method of `Model` adds the entity into the system via adding the entity into `Shop`.

### View Feature

### Current Implementation

The view function is facilitated by `ViewXCommand` (`X` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `ViewCustomerCommand`).

Here X can be appointment/customer/service/technician/vehicle.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the execute("viewcustomer 1") API call.

<img src="images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png"/>

This feature is implemented this way to best match how existing list and find function is done.

This is done this way so that the code is easily maintainable and readable if once the developer understands how `listX` functions works.

However, as you may have noticed, `ViewPartCommand`'s diagram differs slightly.

The Sequence Diagram that illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the execute("viewpartcommand 1") API call is to be added.

* To add image *






### TotalAppointmentCommand Feature

#### Current Implementation

The `totalAppointmentCommand` feature mainly involves iterating through the appointment list and checking if the specified date falls on the same date as the appointment. The way that the validation check is done is by setting the previous day to be the start date and the next day to be the end date. Finally, we check if the current appointment is within the start and end date.



### Undo/Redo Feature

#### Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `StackUndoRedo`. The implemented undo/redo feature would be best described as two stacks of commands that the user has performed:

- `undoStack` serves to store a "history" of the commands they have performed.
- `redoStack` is a collection of their commands that lead up to initial state at which they started performing the undo.

The central concept is to store a stack of commands that essentially functions as a history-list of the commands. Essentially, we leverage on the stack's data structure which is a linear data structure based on the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). Based on the implementation described above, `undoStack` is populated by pushing a user's command in the application.

Then, when the user performs an undo, the command is firstly popped from `undoStack` and used to restore previous state, and then we store that command onto `redoStack`.

`StackUndoRedo` contains 2 stacks, `undoStack` and `redoStack`. The `undoStack` and `redoStack` contain commands that are of type `RedoableCommand`. `RedoableCommand` extends Command and has the following attributes and methods.

![UndoRedo0](images/UndoRedo0.png)

When a `RedoableCommand` is being executed, the methods `saveAddressBookSnapshot(Model model)` will be called. This ensures that the current states are stored within the command.

After a command is executed, it will be added into the `StackUndoRedo`. The specific process is explained in the activity diagram below.

![UndoRedo0](images/UndoRedo1.png)

Next, when undo is being performed, `undoStack` will remove the first command in its stack and add it to `redoStack`. It will then call `RedoableCommand` `undo()` of the command that is removed. The `undo()` method will then set the model to the previous snapshot of `saveAddressBookSnapshot`.

Likewise, when redo is being performed, `redoStack` will remove the first command in its stack and add it to `undoStack`. It will then call `RedoableCommand` `redo()` of the command that is removed. The `redo()` method will then execute the command again.

Given below is an example of a usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `StackUndoRedo` will be initialized.

![UndoRedo0](images/UndoRedo2.png)

Step 2. The user executes delete command. The delete command will be pushed into the `undoStack` of `StackUndoRedo`.

![UndoRedo0](images/UndoRedo3.png)

Step 3. The user executes add customer command to add a new customer. Similarly, the add command will be pushed into the `undoStack` of `StackUndoRedo`.

![UndoRedo0](images/UndoRedo4.png)

Step 4. The user now decides that adding of customer was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the undo command.

![UndoRedo0](images/UndoRedo5.png)


> <b>Note:</b> undoCommand will check if there is any command that can be undone by calling `StackUndoRedo` canUndo() method.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoRedo0](images/UndoRedo6.png)

> <b>Note:</b> The redo command will call `popRedo()` method in `StackUndoRedo`and `redo()` method in `RedoableCommand` .

Step 5. The user executes listcustomers. Due to not being an `UndoCommand` or `RedoCommand`, it causes the `redoStack`
to be cleared.  Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`.

![UndoRedo0](images/UndoRedo7.png)



#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Implementation is easy.
    * Cons: Memory usage may cause performance issues.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command has attached logic that allows it to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. just save what is being deleted).
    * Cons: Must ensure that the implementation of each command is correct. Adds a lot of complexity that may not seem justified as it is to only accommodate the undo/redo feature.

**Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use 2 stacks to store the history of the Models.
    * Pros: Implementation is easier and the logic would be much more manageable to debug.
    * Cons: Duplicated Logic.

* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo.
    * Pros: Does not need to maintain separate stacks and able to use what is in the codebase.
    * Cons: Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns are violated as `HistoryManager` would need to handle more than one thing. For example, it would need to handle the undo and redo as well as the history of the application. This is in contrast with a HistoryManager which is only responsible for the history of the application.
